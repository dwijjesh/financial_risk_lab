# Monte Carlo Simulation – Reliance Industries

## Objective
To analyze long-horizon downside risk for Reliance Industries using
Monte Carlo simulation and understand why probability of loss can
remain high even over multi-year horizons.

## Why Reliance?
Reliance Industries was chosen due to its long trading history,
high liquidity, and exposure to multiple economic regimes.
Its structural growth makes it a strong test case for evaluating
the limitations of standard Monte Carlo assumptions.

## Method
- Historical log returns
- Mean and volatility estimated from past data
- 20,000 Monte Carlo simulations
- 5-year investment horizon

## Key Observations
- Probability of loss remains elevated even over longer horizons
- Outcome distribution is highly skewed
- Extreme downside paths dominate risk metrics

## Limitations
- Assumes stationary returns
- Ignores regime changes
- Overestimates downside risk for structurally growing firms

## Next Improvements
- Regime-based volatility
- Drawdown-focused metrics
- SIP vs lump sum comparison
