# Monte Carlo Simulation

**Question :**
Why does probability of loss remain high even over 5–10 year horizons?

**Method**
- Log returns
- Rolling volatility
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Historical data (2000–2024)

**Key Insight**
- Standard Monte Carlo assumes stationary returns, which breaks
under structural earnings growth, leading to overstated downside risk.

**Next Improvements**
- Regime-based volatility
- Drawdown-focused metrics
- SIP vs lump sum comparison
