# Financial Risk Lab
I analyze where financial models work and where they fail.
This repository explores long-horizon risk, drawdowns, and
decision-making on Indian equities using models and data.

 **Flagship Analysis**
- Monte Carlo simulation for Indian stocks
- Focus on probability of loss, drawdowns, and regime behavior
- Emphasis on model assumptions and failure cases

**Questions I Explore**
- Why does long-term risk remain high in simulations?
- Why does Monte Carlo overestimate downside?
- Is drawdown more relevant than return for investors?

**Work in Progress**
- Regime-aware simulations
- SIP vs lump sum analysis
- Stress testing extreme market scenarios
